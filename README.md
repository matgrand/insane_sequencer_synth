# insane_sequencer_synth
 Sequencer and synthesizer based on an ESP32 chip, that wants to be a very cheap "alternative" to the OP-1

This project is just a little bit more than an idea. When something will begin to work I'll update the repo.
Planning to use Mozzi library as synth engine, if porting to esp32 is reliable.

I'm also getting started with github, I will make a lot of mistakes, hopefully this repo is going to improve with time.
